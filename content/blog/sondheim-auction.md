I had just seen a matinee of Flying Over Sunset. A show James Lapine’s involvement got me in the door for. Afterwards, I found myself walking through Times Square, probably one of the first times since the start of the pandemic, and my phone rang. And as I got the news of Sondheim’s death, whispers of others finding out were happening all around me.
It was devastating. I was devastated. He had survived the most dangerous part of the pandemic. He had just attended the reopening of Company. It felt so sudden. And he was a major inspiration of mine.

So of course a few years later, when the opportunity came to sift through his belongings with the rest of the theatre community, also known as attending the Collection of Stephen Sondheim auction, I knew I couldn’t miss it.

The items were on display for several days before the auction. And walking into Doyle’s display room was an experience of its own. There was a very welcoming gentleman, who so wanted to make everyone aware of the details of the actual auction in hopes of actual bids (little did he know how unnecessary this would become). But his excitement and awe eventually was broadcast to the world during the auction. And then there was a woman behind the counter who was incredibly stingy on handing out the full catalogues. Her reasons forever unknown.

One thing that is incredibly exciting about viewing these items in an auction house versus a museum: they let you touch pretty much anything for however long you wish, in whichever way you wish, even when they probably shouldn’t.

You could have sat on his daybed for a moment, the one that he wrote many lyrics on, just in case you wanted to see what it felt like.
One man assembled many never seen promotional puzzles from his little known film, The Last of Sheila, just to see what they looked like.
And I spent well over an hour, sitting at a table of his, looking through a 1987 score of Follies with handwritten changes for the original West End run.
Even with some of the most exciting items pulled at the last second (handmade Sondheim games in particular), it still felt odd for some of it to be auctioned off rather than preserved. His pencils. (Which went for over $10,000 between lots!) His stationery. (Over $15,000!) And even his thesauruses. (Over $50,000 between lots!)
